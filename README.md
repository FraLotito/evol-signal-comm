# A Signal-Centric Perspective on the Evolution of Symbolic Communication

## Abstract
The evolution of symbolic communication is a longstanding open research question in biology. While some theories suggest that it originated from sub-symbolic communication (i.e., iconic or in- dexical), little experimental evidence exists on how organisms can actually evolve to define a shared set of symbols with unique in- terpretable meaning, thus being capable of encoding and decod- ing discrete information. Here, we use a simple synthetic model composed of sender and receiver agents controlled by Continuous- Time Recurrent Neural Networks, which are optimized by means of neuro-evolution. We characterize signal decoding as either regres- sion or classification, with limited and unlimited signal amplitude. First, we show how this choice affects the complexity of the evolu- tionary search, and leads to different levels of generalization. We then assess the effect of noise, and test the evolved signaling sys- tem in a referential game. In various settings, we observe agents evolving to share a dictionary of symbols, with each symbol spon- taneously associated to a 1-D unique signal. Finally, we analyze the constellation of signals associated to the evolved signaling sys- tems and note that in most cases these resemble a Pulse Amplitude Modulation system.
